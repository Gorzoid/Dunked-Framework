# Dunked-Framework

Written by IAmPhage

A small, simple GMod menu state injectable. This project is based off of work done by @Leystryku with his project Synchronicity which can be found [here.](https://github.com/Leystryku/Synchronicity)
The main purpose of this project is to allow people to bypass existing anti-cheats in GMod (CAC, LAC, etc) while not having to rely on extreme work arounds or retarded lua fuckery. Do whatever as long as you do credit me.
